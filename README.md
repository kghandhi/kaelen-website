# Kaelen's Website

A professional website for Jazz musician Kaelen Ghandhi.

## Running

Cloned from [bootstrap grayscale](git@github.com:BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale.git).

To build,
```
npm install # install dependencies
npm start # start the browsersync
```

### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
