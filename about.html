          I play all saxophones (tenor being my main) and flute at a high level of competency and am working on clarinet.
          I am a student of Jazz literature but also appreciate and practice classical literature. I can sight read and
          improvise over chord changes at a high level.

          During my time at The New School, I have taken five composition courses and studied composition privately with Jamie Baum and Kirk Nurock.
          I have studied large and small ensemble writing and have written approximately 30 tunes while at The New School. Ten of those tunes
          were larege ensemble arrangements.

          I have basic training via The New School in the use of Sibelius and Protools, and a deeper understanding of Finale and Garage Band
          During the summer of 2016 I was introduced to Filemaker Pro, and the summer of 2017 I was fully trained in Runcamp.

          I have been teaching private lessons for three years now, and get joy out of working iwth children. One of my students was selected
          for the Stanford Jazz Giant Steps big band. Additionally, my first year as an intern at Stanford Jazz Workshop I helped Steven
          Lugerner plan and organize the Miles Ahead program that ran before the camp started that summer.
